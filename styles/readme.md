# Level.css

I am never really sure how aggressive of a reset css or a normalize I ever want in a project or how opinionated that level of hierarchy should be.

Things I typically want from a reset.css:

- Box model reset to `border-box`
- No default margins
- Responsive images and media
- Forms to be semi-consist and to inherit typography related styles
- Code blocks to have a realistic `font-size`

## Installation

```shell
yarn add level.css
```
